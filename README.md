# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
This is a coding quiz challenge to test the knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 
When I click the start button, a timer starts and I am presented with a question. When I answer a question, I am presented with another question. When I answer a question incorrectly 10 seconds are subtracted from the clock. After all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. When the game is over, I can save my initials and score.
